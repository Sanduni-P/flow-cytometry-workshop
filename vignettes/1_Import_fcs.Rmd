## Introduction

Flow cytometry data (regardless of the type of instrument used) is generally saved as a **.fcs** file. This file is populated with raw data, fluorescence intensity (for optics based technologies) and abundance (for mass cytrometry), as well as various metadata including: *user id*, *instrument id*, *dynamic range of instrument*, etc. It is important to be able to interact with and manipulate the **.fcs** file as it gives the users/analysts fine grain control.

## Installing/loading required libraries

You can install all the required packages as follows:

```{r install_libraries, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(c("cytolib", "flowCore", "flowWorkspace", "ggcyto", 
                       "openCyto", "flowStats", "CytoML", "flowClust",
                       "flowClean", "flowAI", "PeacoQC"))
```

For the moment, we only need to load `flowCore` and `flowWorkspace`.

```{r load_library_download_cache, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(flowCore)
library(flowWorkspace)
```

## FlowRepository workshop data

In this workshop we will demonstrate the use of different R packages to analyse publicly available datasets hosted on [FlowRepository](http://flowrepository.org/). The first dataset [FR-FCM-Z5PC](https://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-Z5PC) contains FCS files from a study [assessing the post recovery immune phenotypes from patients infected with COVID-19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34638-2). We are using a subset of the FCS files. The second dataset [FR-FCM-ZZ36](http://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-ZZ36) contains FCS files for OMIP-018, a study designed to phenotype T cells for expression of various chemokine receptors.

The data required for this workshop, including subsets extracted from the FlowRepository datasets are made available inside vignettes/data folder.

## `cytoverse` data structures for **.fcs** files

There are four **main** data structures that represent flow cytometry data in `cytoverse`: `cytoframe`, `cytoset`, `GatingHierarchy` and `GatingSet`.

-   `cytoframe`: a single **.fcs** file,
-   `cytoset`: a list like object that can store multiple **.fcs** files,
-   `GatingHierarchy`: a list like object that allows building and attaching gates and filter to a `cytoframe`
-   `GatingSet`: a list like object that allows building and attaching gates and filter to a `cytoset`

Some of these have overlapping functionality, and we'll eventually explain when you would prefer one data structure to another as we continue through this workshop.

There are additional legacy data structures called `flowFrame` and `flowSet` in `cytoverse` that are analogous to `cytoframe` and `cytoset` in function. We will briefly discuss these data structures in this workshop.

## Reading an FCS file

There are two preferred approaches to read in **.fcs** file(s) into R:

-   Read in individual **.fcs** files as `cytoframe` (associated with `flowWorkspace` package) or `flowFrame` (associated with `flowCore` package)
-   Read in a set of **.fcs** files as `cytoset` (associated with `flowWorkspace` package) or `flowSet` (associated with `flowCore` package)

(Additionally, you can read a workspace generated with another tool, such as FlowJo, using the `CytoML` package.)

### Working with `cytoframe` or `flowFrame` objects

A few useful definitions that help us get oriented with the underlying data in the `cytoframe`/`flowFrame` object.

-   **Channels**: Instrument derived labels of various parameters that were measured. Channels are the column names of the `cytoframe`/`flowFrame`. Any data generated from the same instrument will have the same (similar) Channel names.
-   **Markers**: User provided labels for various parameters that were measured. For example: Channel name: B710-A, Marker name: CD3. Marker names are set by the users and may not be unique across experiments/users. Not all channels are markers -- some are physical parameters such as the forward scatter or side scatter. These channels will have their marker names set to `NA`.
-   **Expression**: Measured values. A matrix where every row is an event (frequently a cell) and every column is a channel.

Working with a `cytoframe`/`flowFrame` object is very similar to working with a `data.frame` in R, where a "row" is a cell and a "column" is a channel.

#### Reading an FCS file as a `cytoframe` object

The function `load_cytoframe_from_fcs` is used to read in individual file as a `cytoframe` object.

```{r load_cytoframe, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message = FALSE}
cf <- load_cytoframe_from_fcs("data/fcs-data/4000_BDC-CR1.fcs")
# a cytoframe object
cf
```

#### Reading an FCS file as a `flowFrame` object

To read a FCS file as a `flowFrame` object: (standard for Flow Cytometry)

```{r}
ff <- read.FCS("data/fcs-data/4000_BDC-CR1.fcs")
# a flowFrame object
ff
```

#### `cytoframe` versus `flowFrame` objects

Both `cytoframe` and `flowFrame` object has 3 slots where various data is stored.

-   `exprs(cf)`: stores the expression matrix (i.e. the collected data),
-   `parameters(cf)`: stores information pertaining to channels: channel name, marker description,and data ranges as an AnnotatedDataFrame,
-   `keyword(cf)`: stores additional information extracted from the **.fcs** file header. The file header follow ISAC guidelines. Visit [here](https://isac-net.org/page/Data-Standards) for more information.

::: callout-tip
In R, the `@` and `$` operators serve the purpose of accessing elements within an object. However, it is \textcolor{red}{not advisable} to employ these operators for accessing elements directly. A recommended practice is to use functions and methods explicitly designed for this purpose, as will be discussed in the next section.

-   To extract any \textcolor{lpink}{pink} or \textcolor{lblue}{blue} slot shown in @fig-flowframe the `@` operator is used. On the other hand, to extract any \textcolor{lgreen}{green} slot the `$` operator is used.
-   In general, the `@` operator is used to extract/replace contents of a slot or property of an object. The `$` operator is used to extract/replace parts on vectors, matrices, arrays or lists. 
:::

::: callout-note
Interacting with a `cytoframe` is very similar to interacting with a `flowframe`, with one important difference. While operations such as subsetting or copying a `flowFrame` using the standard R assignment operator (`<-`) will perform a deep copy of the data in its slots, the same operations on a `cytoframe` will produce a view to the same underlying data as the original object. This means that changes made to the `cytoframe` resulting from subsetting or copying will affect the original `cytoframe.` 
:::

**From this point onwards, we focus on examples and usages involving the `cytoframe` object, with the majority of the content dedicated to exploring and understanding this specific data structure.**

### Examples

#### Accessing parameter summary and metadata

Summary of measured parameters.

```{r accessor_examples, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# parameters
parameters(cf) |> pData() # show as a dataframe

```

Various metadata present in the **.fcs** files.

```{r}
# keywords
keyword(cf) |> head(10) # only show the first 10

```

#### Channels, Expression, and Subsets

```{r channels, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# channels
colnames(cf)

# markernames
markernames(cf)

# instrument channel ranges
range(cf, type = "instrument")

# expression
exprs(cf)[1:5, 1:5]

# number of events
nrow(cf)

# number of channels 
ncol(cf)

# dimesnions (nrows, nclos)
dim(cf)
```

Notice that there is a correspondence between channels, markers, and the expression matrix. i.e. the `names` of the named vector `markernames(cf)` are a subset of the columns of the expression matrix `exprs(cf)` as well as the columns of the `cytoframe`.

#### Preliminary statistics

```{r}
# summary of expression
summary(cf)

# median value across each row
row_stat <- each_row(cf, median)
head(row_stat)

# mean value across each row
col_stat <- each_col(cf, mean)
head(col_stat)
```

Statistic functions listed under location and scale estimator in [matrxStats page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/matrixStats/vignettes/matrixStats-methods.html) can be used as the second argument in `each_row(argument1, argument2)` and `each_col(argument1, argument2)` functions.

#### Aditional examples

```{r correspondance, echo=TRUE,message=FALSE}
# interested marker: CD4
# easy to find which channel is mapped to CD4
CD4_chan <- flowCore::getChannelMarker(
  frm = cf,
  name = "CD4"
)$name

# inspect CD4_chan
CD4_chan

# extract expression of cd4
e_cd4 <- exprs(cf[, CD4_chan])
head(e_cd4)

# subset cytorame by column
s_cf <- cf[, CD4_chan]
s_cf

# subset cytoframe by row
s2_cf <- cf[1:100, ]
s2_cf
```

Notice that the subset (`[]`) operation can be applied directly to the `cytoframe` object so that information regarding the file is preserved. Also, as indicated above, these operations provide an aliased view of the data without creating a **copy**.

Below, we show examples of how to manipulate the `cytoframe` object and create a copy using `realize_view()`:

```{r manipulate_flowFrame, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# create a new markername
new_name <- c("U785-A" = "test")

# create a new cytoframe subset
cf_sub <- cf[1:150, ] |> realize_view() # realize_view creates a new cytoframe, distinct from the original

# old markernames
markernames(cf_sub)

# set new markername
markernames(cf_sub) <- new_name
markernames(cf_sub)

# manipulating expression values
# notice the data range 
range(cf_sub[, "U785-A"])

# visualise original channel ditribution
plot(
  density(
    exprs(cf_sub[, "U785-A"])
  ),
  main = "U785-A"
)

# asinh transform
exprs(cf_sub)[, "U785-A"] <- asinh(exprs(cf_sub)[, "U785-A"])

# notice the data range after transformation
range(
  cf_sub[, "U785-A"],
  type = "instrument"
)

# visualise channel distribution
plot(
  density(
    exprs(cf_sub[, "U785-A"])
  ),
  main = "U785-A"
)

```

Notice that the data range summary was not updated when we used `<-` to change the underlying expression matrix. A good practice is to use `transform` function to transform the underlying expression matrix. Importantly, `transform` also updates the data range summary. Moreover, `transform` can also be used to add new columns to the `cytoframe`.

*Note*: We will go over `transformations` in a later section.

### Basic plots using `flowViz` package

`flowViz` package provide functions and methods to visualize flow cytometry data. This package heavily depends on the flowCore package.

```{r}
#| output: false
library(flowViz)
```

#### Examples

If the object has only a single parameter this produces a histogram. To select specific parameters from a flowFrame for plotting, either subset the object or specify the parameters as a character vector as shown below.

```{r}
plot(cf, c("FSC-A"))
```

For exactly two parameters this plots a [bivariate density map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_map#:~:text=A%20bivariate%20map%20or%20multivariate,%2C%20cartogram%2C%20or%20proportional%20symbols).

```{r}
#| fig-height: 5
plot(cf, c("FSC-A", "SSC-A"))
```

For more than two parameters this produce a simple scatter plots matrix (splom). The smooth parameters lets you toggle between density-type smoothScatter plots and regular scatterplots. For far more sophisticated plotting of flow cytometry data, ggcyto package is used generally (will be discussed later).

For multiple parameters,

```{r}
#| cache: true
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 12
all_param = dput(colnames(cf)[6:8])
plot(cf, all_param)
```

## Reading a set of FCS files

In a experimental sense, a single **.fcs** file is not very interesting, since this represents only a single sample. To draw any conclusions, we'll want replicates. When there are a set of **.fcs** files they can be loaded into R either as a `cytoset` or `flowSet`.

**cytoset/flowSet**: A collection of **.fcs** files, preferably, but not necessarily from the same panel/experiment.

### Reading a set of FCS files as a `cytoset`

```{r cytoset_example, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
cs <- load_cytoset_from_fcs(path = "data/fcs-data/")
cs
```

### Reading a set of FCS files as a `flowSet`

```{r flowSet_example, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
frames <- lapply(dir("data/fcs-data/", full.names=TRUE), read.FCS)
fs <- as(frames, "flowSet") 
fs
```
A `cytoset`/`flowSet` can also be indexed with square brackets `cs[i,j]`, however now the row index `i` selects samples (**individual FCS files**) rather than cells. A `cytoset`/`flowSet` also behaves like a list -- a double bracket `cs[[i]]` selects a single sample as a `cytoframe`/`flowFrame`.

Generally, each FCS file replicate has unique metadata properties that can (**and should**) be supplied to the `cytoset`/`flowSet`. These can be added after loading the `cytoset`/`flowSet` by using `pData(x) <- data.frame`. The `rownames` of the data.frame **must match** the `sampleNames` of the `cytoset`/`flowSet`.

::: callout-note
The primary difference between the `cytoset` and `flowSet` classes is in the underlying representation of the data. Because `cytoset` is a reference class, copying or subsetting a `cytoset` object will return a `cytoset` pointing to the same underlying data. A deep copy of the data can be obtained via the realize_view method as before.

There is one notable exception to the typical behavior of most methods returning a `cytoframe`. The standard extraction operator (`[[]]`) will by default perform a deep copy of the subset being extracted and return a `flowFrame`. 
:::

**Here onwards, we focus on examples involving the `cytoset` object, with the majority of the content dedicated to exploring and understanding this specific data structure.**

```{r show_metadata_cs, echo=TRUE,message=TRUE}
# prior to providing metadata
pData(cs)

# create metadata
metadata <- data.frame(
  Treatment = rep(c("Untreated","Treated"),
    length.out = length(cs)
  ),
  panel = ifelse(
    grepl(
      pattern = "TNK",
      x = sampleNames(cs)
    ),
    "T Cell Panel",
    "Myeloid Panel"
  )
)
```

Let's see what happens when `rownames` do not match!

```{r metadata_cs_error, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, error=TRUE}
# try to add metadata  -- this leads to an error
pData(cs) <- metadata
```

Now, we ensure that `rownames` of data.frame matches `sampleNames` of the `cytoset`.

```{r metadata_cs_samplenames, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=TRUE}
# now it works
row.names(metadata) <- sampleNames(cs)
pData(cs) <- metadata
pData(cs)
```

The benefit of having metadata is that we can use many of the sub-setting operations in a metadata specific manner.

This is much more convenient than going back and forth between the full set of files.

```{r cytoset_subset, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
# subset by files that have myeloid staining panel without creating a copy of the data
cs_myeloid <- cs[pData(cs)[["panel"]] == "Myeloid Panel",]

cs_myeloid
pData(cs_myeloid)
```

### Cytoset views and aliasing

Many of the sub-setting operation for `cytoframe` are also applicable for `cytoset`. Similar to `cytoframe` sub-setting operations only create a new "view" of the data. For a complete copy of the data, `realize_view` should be used.

Below is an example of `cytoset` sub-setting which also highlights how the operations performed on `cytoset` affects the underlying data.

```{r cytoset_subset_2, echo=TRUE,message=TRUE}
# demonstrate how cs point to the same underlying data
range(cs[[1, "B515-A"]])

# subset and show prior to transformation
cs_small <- cs[1]
range(cs_small[[1, "B515-A"]])

# create a transformList
trans <- transformList("B515-A",asinh)

# transform
cs_small <- transform(cs_small,trans)

# after transformation
range(cs_small[[1, "B515-A"]])

# whole cs 
range(cs[[1, "B515-A"]])
```

As you see, the transformation was applied to a subset `cs_small` however the original `cs` was also altered highlighting that both objects were pointing to the same data. To confirm this, you can use `cs_get_uri` or `cf_get_uri`:

```{r}
cs_get_uri(cs_small)
cs_get_uri(cs)
```

To perform a **deep copy** we can use `realize_view()`

```{r cytoset_deep_copy, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
# look at underlying expression
range(cs[[2, "B515-A"]])

# subset and show prior to transformation
cs_small2 <- realize_view(cs[2])
range(cs_small2[[1, "B515-A"]])

# create a transformList
trans <- transformList("B515-A",asinh)

# transform
cs_small2 <- transform(cs_small2,trans)

# after transformation
range(cs_small2[[1, "B515-A"]])

# whole cs 
range(cs[[2, "B515-A"]])
```

Notice that `cs` is left unchanged.

### Adding additional **.fcs** files to `cytoset`

Lastly, we can also add additional **.fcs** files to a `cytoset` using `cs_add_cytoframe`.

```{r add_more_fcs, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
# add to cytoset
cs_small <- realize_view(cs[1]) # cs[1] subsets cs into a cytoset while realize_view leads to a deep_copy into a new cytoset
cs_small

# no need to assign back to cs_small, because this function operates by reference and returns NULL anyways.
cs_add_cytoframe(
  cs = cs_small,
  sn = "Sample Name",
  cf = cs[[3]]   # cs[[3]] results in a cytoframe
) 
cs_small
```

### From `cytoset` to `cytoframe`

It is possible that you may want to extract a `cytoframe` or extract all files as a list of `cytoframe`. We can either use `[[]]` to directly grab a `cytoframe` or `cytoset_to_list`.

```{r cytoset_to_cytoframe, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE}
# extract a single cytoframe by using cs[[index/samplename]]
single_cf <- cs[[1]]

# convert to a list
list_of_cf <- cytoset_to_list(cs) 
```

### List like operation with `cytoset`

As indicated previously, a `cytoset` behaves like a list. To leverage this behaviour we can use `fsApply` to iterate through the samples in a `cytoset`. By default, output is attempted to be coerced to a single array like object. (Set `simplify = FALSE` to return another list.)

```{r fsApply, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# getting number of rows (cells) of individual cytoframes
n_cell_events <- fsApply(cs, nrow)
n_cell_events
```

## Methods for conversion between `cyto-` and `flow-` objects

```{r cyto_to_flo, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE}
# convert a flowframe to cytoframe 
ff_new <- cytoframe_to_flowFrame(cf)

# convert a cytoframe to flowframe 
cf_new <- flowFrame_to_cytoframe(ff)

# convert a flowset to cytoset 
fs_new <- cytoset_to_flowSet(cs)

# convert a cytoset to flowset 
cs_new <- flowSet_to_cytoset(fs)
```

## Saving your data

Saving `cyto-` data is easy.

```{r save_cyto, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# save cytoframe
cf_write_disk(cf, "path/to/my_new_cf")

# save cytoset
save_cytoset(cs, path = "path/to/my/cs")
```

Loading it back is just as easy.

```{r load_cf_cs, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load cytoframe
load_cytoframe("path/to/my_cf")

# load cytoset
load_cytoset("path/to/my/cs")

```

Writing `flow-` data is easy.

```{r save_flow,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# write flowFrame
write.FCS(ff, "path/to/my_new_ff")

# write flowSet
write.flowSet(fs, path = "path/to/my/cs")
```

We have previously discussed how to read FCS files into a `flowFrame` or `flowSet` objects. 

## Conclusion

We went through multiple ways to import, interact with, and manipulate **.fcs** files using the `cytoverse` tools. It is important to note additional functionality, *which we will not going to go over at this workshop for the sake of time*, for further manipulation and even creation of **.fcs** files exist with the `cytoverse`. We encourage you to explore them further at your leisure by calling `browseVignettes("flowWorkspace")` and `browseVignettes("flowCore")`.
